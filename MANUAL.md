[Deku Engine Manual]


The Deku Engine editor enables you to create 3D games and apps. The Deku Engine Manual helps you learn how to 
use the Deku Engine editor.

.- Basics:
	Download the current release of the engine from "https://github.com/SergiPC/Game_Engine". Descompress
	the .zip file, go to the new folder and double-click on the executable.

.- Getting started:
	Whenever you launch the Deku Engine editor, the Main Screen displays. For now, you just can upload the
	"Street environment_V01.fbx" file and apply som transformations, or create new empty Game Objects.
	
	.- Bar Menu:
		1. Inside "File option" you can choose the project you want to open, get a new one, or save the 
		scene ("New" and "Save" options are not enabled yet). Also you can exit the editor clicking on "Quit" 
		or pressing the "Esc" key.

		2. Inside "Window" you can enable or disable UI windows.

		3. On "Help" you will find different informative links about the project.

	.- To create Game Objects:
		1. "Hierarchy Menu" represents the hierarchy of Game Objects of the scene. With the option "Create" 
		you can create new empty Game Objects.

	.- Inspector & components:
		1. "Inspector Menu" is used to view and edit the properties and settings of Game Objects. When you 
		select a GameObject in the Hierarchy, the Inspector will show the Properties of all Components and 
		Materials on that object and allow you to edit them.

		2. Also you can add components with the option below them.

	.- Editor configurations:
		1. In the configuration window you can change the window options and view information about fps 
		and hardware (It aims to add more options over time).
